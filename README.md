# Asana Project

## Description

This project pulls data from the Asana API, filters and sorts it by client & tasks completed, and finally feeds it to ChatGPT using the OpenAI API to return a weekly summary broken down by client. In order to receive your own personal weekly summary, please add the necessary API keys to the .env file and update the cron scheduler in the index.js file.
